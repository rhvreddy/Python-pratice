# I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.
#
#
#
# Create a function called life_in_weeks() using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many weeks we have left, if we live until 90 years old.
#
#
#
# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
#
#
#
# You have x weeks left.
#
#
#
# Where x is replaced with the actual calculated number of weeks the input age has left until age 90.
#
#
#
# **Warning** The function must be called life_in_weeks for the tests to pass. Also the output must have the same punctuation and spelling as the example. Including the full stop!
#
#
#
# Example Input
#
# 56
#
#
#
# Example Output
#
# You have 1768 weeks left.
#
#
#
# How to test your code and see your output?
#
#
#
# Udemy coding exercises do not have a console, so you cannot use input() . You will need to call your function with hard-coded values like so:
#
#
#
# def life_in_weeks(age):
#   # your code here
#
#
# # Call your function with hard coded values
# life_in_weeks(12)


def life_in_weeks(age):
    years_remaining = 90 - age
    weeks_remaining = years_remaining * 52
    print(f"You have {weeks_remaining} weeks left.")


life_in_weeks(12)
